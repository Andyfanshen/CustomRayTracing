# Fullscreen

Use the Fullscreen Master Stack to create a Shader Graph material to apply to the entire screen at the end of the rendering process. You can use this to create custom post-process and custom pass effects.

A full-screen shader that applies a raindrop effect to the screen.

# Contexts

A shader graph contains the following contexts: 

- [Vertex context](#vertex-context)
- [Fragment context](#fragment-context)

The Fullscreen Master Stack has its own [Graph Settings](#graph-settings) that determine which blocks you can use in the Shader Graph contexts. 

This section contains information on the blocks that this Master Stack material type uses by default, and which blocks you can use to affect the Graph Settings.

## <a name="vertex-context"></a>Vertex context

The Vertex context represents the vertex stage of this shader. Unity executes any block you connect to this context in the vertex function of this shader. For more information, refer to [Master Stack](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@14.0/manual/Master-Stack.html).

Vertex blocks are not compatible with the Fullscreen Master Stack.

## <a name="fragment-context"></a>Fragment context

The Fragment context represents the fragment (or pixel) stage of this shader. Unity executes any block you connect to this context in the fragment function of this shader. For more information, refer to [Master Stack](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@14.0/manual/Master-Stack.html).

### Default

When you create a new Fullscreen Master Stack, the Fragment context contains the following blocks by default.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
[!include[](../snippets/shader-graph-blocks/base-color.md)]

| **Depth Write Mode**          | Determines the depth value’s input format before Unity passes it to the depth buffer. This property determines which Depth block you can use in the [Fragment context](#fragment-context).This property appears when you enable **Depth Write**. |                                                              |

## <a name="custom-blend-modes"></a>Custom Blend Mode

Use the **Custom** blend mode to create a blend mode different from those available in [Surface Options](#surface-options). To show these options, set **Blend Mode** to **Custom**. The Custom blend mode properties specify the blending operation to use for this full-screen shader’s alpha and color channels. 

In the blend mode properties, **Src** (source) refers to the full-screen shader itself. **Dst** (destination) refers to the Scene camera’s raw output, which this shader doesn't affect. The blending operation applies the source contents to the destination contents to produce a rendering result.

For more information on the blending equation, refer to [ShaderLab command: Blend](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Blend.html).

### Color Blend Mode

Determines the blending equation Unity uses for the red, green, and blue channels (RGB). Each setting defines one part of the equation.
